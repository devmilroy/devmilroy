#### Senior IT Associate / Aspiring Front-end Web Developer

I am currently a senior IT associate at Human Rights Watch, based in New York, NY. I've been independently studying web development for the past year and hope to pursue front-end full-time in the coming year! I love coding and creating beautiful yet functional content. 

#### Currently Working On ✍🏼
 - HTML
 - CSS / SASS
 - JavaScript
 - React.js
 - Bootstrap

I'm also working to showcase my skills by publishing my personal website! I plan to populate it with future projects that best show my skill behind the keyboard and my eye for creativity.
